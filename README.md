# Codingwith Dill - React Native Tutorials

Welcome to the Codingwith Dill GitHub repository! This tutorial covers the implementation of backend API calls in React Native using the fetch API. It includes comprehensive guidance on performing various types of requests, including GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE. Additionally, a separate file named DAL.js is provided to streamline the usage of fetch, enhancing code readability and maintainability.

Features:
GET Request: Fetch data from the backend server using the GET method.
POST Request: Send data to the backend server using the POST method.
PUT Request: Update existing data on the backend server using the PUT method.
PATCH Request: Modify specific data on the backend server using the PATCH method.
DELETE Request: Remove data from the backend server using the DELETE method.
Error Handling: Gracefully handle network errors and exceptions during API calls.

Usage:
Import the DAL object from the provided file.
Utilize the respective methods (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE) of the DAL object for performing API requests.
Example:

import { DAL } from './DAL';

// Example of making a GET request
const fetchData = async () => {
  try {
    const data = await DAL.GET('/posts');
    console.log(data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
  }
};

// Example of making a POST request
const addData = async () => {
  const requestBody = { title: 'New Post', body: 'Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet' };
  try {
    const responseData = await DAL.POST('/posts', requestBody);
    console.log(responseData);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
  }
};

// Additional examples for PUT, PATCH, and DELETE requests can be similarly implemented.

Note:
Replace the baseURL within the DAL object with your actual backend API URL.
Ensure proper error handling and data validation based on your application requirements.
